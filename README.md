# Olympic Medal Prediction with Machine Learning

## 📌 About the Project
This project aims to predict the number of medals a country will win in the Olympics using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical Olympic data, considering factors such as economic indicators, population, and past performances.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data preprocessing and manipulation
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning model development
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Experimentation and analysis

## 🔍 Project Features
This project includes the following steps:
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring historical Olympic datasets
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the relationship between different factors and medal counts
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming relevant features for model training
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implementing various machine learning models to predict medal counts
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the performance of selected models
- **Prediction & Insights**: Analyzing model outputs and key influencing factors
